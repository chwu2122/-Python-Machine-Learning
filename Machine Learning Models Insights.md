# Recap for machine learning models Insights

This is a quick recap for [Machine Learning for Insights -- Extract human understandable insights from any Machine Learning model](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-for-insights) from Kaggle.  
It covers Permutation Importance, Partial Dependence Plots and SHAP Values. I grouped them together to make it more scalable. Essentially, this makes machine learning models more interpretable. 

I found there are two great resources that dive into Interpretable Machine Learning in more depth.   
Book: [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)  
NoteBook: [Interpretable Machine Learning with Python](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/intrepretable-machine-learning-nfl-combine.html)
